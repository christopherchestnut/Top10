# Important Notice

This version is not a final draft. 

We have worked extensively to validate the methodology, obtained a great deal of data on over 114,000 apps, and obtained qualitive data via survey by 550 community members on the two new categories - deserialization and insufficient logging and monitoring.

We strongly urge for any corrections or issues to be logged at GitHub
* https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/issues

Through public transparency, we provide traceability and ensure that all voices are heard during this final month before publication.
