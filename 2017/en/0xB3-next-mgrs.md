## AppSec Program

Application Security is not the Dark Arts, it's a highly repeatable facet of software engineering. The primary aim of any CISO or application owner is to reduce the risks to the organization by addressing the most important issues in a highly repeatable, business as usual fashion. 

To that end, we suggest:

* Consider reviewing your application security program against the [OWASP SAMM](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_SAMM_Project) project. This project has 12 major domains, each of which can assist with maturing any appsec program, regardless of size

* Move left; by this we mean the old days of performing a penetration test just before (or usually after) you go live is not particularly effective if that's the entireity of your application security program. Implement security into your agile SDLC, and ensure security is just another team member that helps to enable secure business.

* Ensure you have an effective data asset list, so you can ensure that all applications have appropriate controls, risk management and safeguards. The growth of software as a service places special burdens on organizations, as often the data is outside the traditional security boundary, and yet you cannot outsource responsibility for issues such as privacy or compliance. With the EU GDPR and other regulations containing significant penalties for mishandling data, it's more critical than ever to understand where your data is, and the controls over it. 

* Training and investing in your people. Security is not a technology issue; it's a people problem. Make sure your staff and contractors are aware of their obligations to produce secure software, rather than rely on a small non-scalable team. This may mean providing "secure development" training or similar for developers and architects. Penetration testing training would be best suited for quality assurance, rather than development staff. 

* Managing application security must cover all phases of the SDLC, from ensuring adequate resourcing, business requirements and limits, ensuring that development teams are continuously improving, ensuring that testing verifies all of the security activities to that point, build covers off simple things like ensuring the build breaks if outdated or vulnerable components are found, and there is adequate monitoring, escalation and incident response management in place. 

## Metrics

A key issue is how do you measure the reduction in risk, year on year, especially if you are just starting out on an app sec program, or engaging in new ways of testing applications and APIs.

Some metrics to get you going include:

* How many defects are currently known per application?
  * Does this indicate security technical debt or training requirements?
  * Does this indicate the need to upgrade or replace certain platforms?
* How many critical, high and medium risks have been resolved over time?
* How much does a security defect cost to resolve? This helps provide the investment case for training, retiring known technical debt, and helping the business surface the true costs of going live with unknown risk
* How effective are your testing partners in reducing your risk? Do they help find impactful issues? Could they be better used in some way?
* How many apps have never been tested? Do they contain any sensitive data assets? 
* Tracking if testing is overdue or required for regulatory compliance reasons, such as PCI ASV scans or privacy impact assessments

There are many forms of metrics that can be found. Be careful of metrics that don't align business and security, but instead aim to reduce costs - such as cost per bug. At a certain point, KPIs need to be aligned with enabling secure business, not cost reductions. 


## This is just the start

Starting the application security journey can feel overwhelming. A key takeaway is that you can't review your way to building a bridge; at some point you must build it. Let's ensure that security is deeply esconced within the organization, and aligned with organizational objectives.
