# Introduction

## Welcome

Welcome to the OWASP Top 10 2017! This major update adds several new issues, including two issues selected by the community - A8:2017-Deserialization and A10:2017-Insufficient logging and monitoring. Community feedback also drove the collection of the most amount of data ever assembled in the preparation of an application security standard, and so we are confident that the remaining 8 issues are the most important for organizations to address, particularly the A3:2017-Exposure of Sensitive Data in the age of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, A5:2017-Misconfiguration especially around cloud and API services, and A9:2017 Known Vulnerabilities, which can be especially challenging for those on modern platforms, like node.js. 

The OWASP Top 10 for 2017 is based primarily on TBA large datasets from firms that specialize in application security, including TBA consulting companies and TBA product vendors. This data spans vulnerabilities gathered from hundreds of organizations and over 114,000 real-world applications and APIs. The Top 10 items are selected and prioritized according to this prevalence data, in combination with consensus estimates of exploitability, detectability, and impact.

A primary aim of the OWASP Top 10 is to educate developers, designers, architects, managers, and organizations about the consequences of the most common and most important web application security weaknesses. The Top 10 provides basic techniques to protect against these high risk problem areas – and also provides guidance on where to go from here.

## Warnings

**Don't stop at 10**. There are hundreds of issues that could affect the overall security of a web application as discussed in the [OWASP Developer's Guide](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Guide_Project) and the [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Cheat_Sheet_Series). These are essential reading for anyone developing web applications and APIs. Guidance on how to effectively find vulnerabilities in web applications and APIs is provided in the OWASP Testing Guide and the OWASP Code Review Guide.

**Constant change**. The OWASP Top 10 will continue to change. Even without changing a single line of your application's code, you may become vulnerable as new flaws are discovered and attack methods are refined. Please review the advice at the end of the Top 10 in “What's Next For Developers, Verifiers, and Organizations” for more information.

**Think positive**. When you're ready to stop chasing vulnerabilities and focus on establishing strong application security controls, OWASP is maintaining and promoting the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project) as a guide to organizations and application reviewers on what to verify.

**Use tools wisely**. Security vulnerabilities can be quite complex and buried in mountains of code. In many cases, the most cost-effective approach for finding and eliminating these weaknesses is human experts armed with good tools.

**Push left, right, and everywhere**. Focus on making security an integral part of your culture throughout your development organization. Find out more in the [OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)]().
